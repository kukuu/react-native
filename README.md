# REACT Native

It is an all in one solution to build native mobile apps for Android and iOS platform in one go and amalgamates native 
app development with JavaScript UI development. It renders apps using real mobile UI components.



## UI Component Examples: 
```

ActivityIndicator

Button

DatePickerIOS

DrawerLayoutAndroid

FlatList

Image

ImageBackground

InputAccessoryView

KeyboardAvoidingView

MaskedViewIOS

Modal

## RESTful Architecture:

We can define a RESTful API as one that is stateless, it separates concerns between 
client-server, it allows caching of data client-side and it utilizes standardized 
base URLs and methods to perform the actions required to manipulate, add or delete data.

```
i. Stateless: Meaning the client data is not stored on the server, the session is stored
client-side (typically in session storage).

ii. Separation of Concerns: Client<->Server: There is a separation of concerns between the front-end (client) and
the back-end (server). They operate independently of each other and both are replaceable.

iii. Cache: Data from the server can be cached on the client, which can improve performance speed.


iv. URL Composition: We use a standardized approach to the composition of base URLs.

For example, a GET request to /cities, should yield all the cities in the database,
whereas a GET request to /cities/seattle would render the city with an ID of seattle. 

v. Similarly, REST utilizes standard methods like GET, PUT, DELETE and POST to perform actions.
Which weâ€™ll take a look at in the next section!
